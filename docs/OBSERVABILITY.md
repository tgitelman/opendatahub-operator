# Managing observability deployment modes

Red Hat OpenShift AI provides centralized platform observability for metrics, traces, and logs. You configure observability on the **Data Science Cluster Initialization** (`DSCInitialization`) custom resource at `spec.monitoring`.

This document describes **four deployment modes** for Red Hat OpenShift AI 3.6 and how to install them with the `rhai-on-openshift-chart` Helm chart. For dashboard usage, workload scraping, and tracing procedures, see [Managing observability](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_ai_self-managed/3.5/html/managing_openshift_ai/managing-observability_managing-rhoai) in the product documentation.

---

## 1. Choose a deployment mode

| Mode | Intent | Required operators |
|------|--------|-------------------|
| **1 — All built-in** | Full stack: metrics, traces, logs, and dashboards in OpenShift AI | Cluster Observability Operator (COO), Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry, Tempo Operator, Loki Operator, Red Hat OpenShift Logging (CLO) |
| **2 — External only** | Forward telemetry to your existing backends; no built-in storage or dashboards | Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry, CLO |
| **3 — None** | No observability module | None |
| **4 — Custom** | Mix built-in and external options per capability | See [Mode 4](#6-mode-4--custom) |

**Mode 1** — Use when you want Prometheus, Tempo, dashboards in OpenShift AI, and log aggregation in the platform.

**Mode 2** — Use when you already have enterprise observability. OpenShift AI deploys collectors and forwarders only. There is no built-in Prometheus, Tempo, Loki, or Observe & monitor dashboards.

**Mode 3** — Use when you do not need platform observability. No observability operator prerequisites.

**Mode 4** — Use when you need only some capabilities (for example metrics only, or traces only). Install the operators that match those capabilities.

**OpenShift AI web application:** Observability settings do not enable the OpenShift AI console by themselves. Set `components.dashboard.dsc.managementState: Managed` so the application appears in the OpenShift application launcher. Built-in observability dashboards appear in OpenShift AI under **Observe & monitor → Dashboard** when the observability stack provides them (typically Mode 1 and some Mode 4 configurations).

---

## 2. Install with Helm

Chart source: [odh-gitops — rhai-on-openshift-chart](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/odh-gitops/tree/main/charts/rhai-on-openshift-chart).

The chart installs the Red Hat OpenShift AI operator, dependency operators (COO, OpenTelemetry, Tempo when enabled), and writes monitoring settings to `DSCInitialization` through `services.monitoring.*` values. Install **OpenShift Logging (CLO)** and **Loki** from OperatorHub when your mode requires them; they are not managed by the chart.

### Chart location

| Source | Registry / path | Login |
|--------|-----------------|-------|
| Pre-release / early access | `oci://quay.io/rhoai/rhai-on-openshift-chart` | `helm registry login quay.io` |
| Generally available (when published) | `oci://registry.redhat.io/rhai/rhai-on-openshift-chart` | `helm registry login registry.redhat.io` |
| Git clone | [opendatahub-io/odh-gitops](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/odh-gitops) `main` → `charts/rhai-on-openshift-chart` | None for the chart path |

```bash
# Example — early access chart from Quay
export CHART_VERSION=v3.6.0-ea.2
helm registry login quay.io
helm upgrade --install rhoai oci://quay.io/rhoai/rhai-on-openshift-chart \
  --version "${CHART_VERSION}" \
  -n rhoai-gitops --create-namespace \
  --set operator.type=rhoai \
  -f values-mode<N>.yaml
```

Match the chart version and OperatorHub channel to your OpenShift AI version. Prefer a **values file** per mode for nested `metrics`, `traces`, and `exporters` keys.

### How monitoring dependencies work

The chart uses the same dependency model for **services** (monitoring) as for **components**. See [How Component Dependencies Work](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/odh-gitops/tree/main/charts/rhai-on-openshift-chart#how-component-dependencies-work).

| Layer | Values | Effect |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Operators | `services.monitoring.dependencies.*` | Whether the chart installs COO, OpenTelemetry, Tempo for monitoring |
| Monitoring config | `services.monitoring.dsci.*` | Writes `spec.monitoring` on `default-dsci` |

Leave top-level `dependencies.*.enabled` at **`auto`** (default) unless you intentionally force operators on or off globally.

### Two-phase install

The first `helm upgrade --install` may create Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) subscriptions only. After operator ClusterServiceVersions show `Succeeded`, run the same Helm command again so `DSCInitialization` and related custom resources are applied. Avoid `helm install --wait` (it can time out). See [Automating Red Hat OpenShift AI installations with Helm and GitOps](https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2026/08/26/automating-red-hat-openshift-ai-installations-with-helm-and-gitops).

Include the OpenShift AI application in every mode values file:

```yaml
components:
  dashboard:
    dsc:
      managementState: Managed
```

### Mode values files

#### Mode 3 — No observability

`values-mode3-none.yaml`:

```yaml
components:
  dashboard:
    dsc:
      managementState: Managed
services:
  monitoring:
    dependencies:
      clusterObservability: false
      opentelemetry: false
      tempo: false
    dsci:
      managementState: Removed
```

#### Mode 1 — All built-in

`values-mode1-builtin.yaml`:

```yaml
components:
  dashboard:
    dsc:
      managementState: Managed
services:
  monitoring:
    dependencies:
      clusterObservability: true
      opentelemetry: true
      tempo: true
    dsci:
      managementState: Managed
      metrics:
        storage:
          size: 5Gi
          retention: 90d
      traces:
        sampleRatio: "0.1"
        storage:
          backend: pv
          size: 5Gi
          retention: 2160h
```

Also install **CLO** and **Loki** from OperatorHub.

#### Mode 2 — External only

`values-mode2-external.yaml`:

```yaml
components:
  dashboard:
    dsc:
      managementState: Managed
services:
  monitoring:
    dependencies:
      clusterObservability: false
      opentelemetry: true
      tempo: false
    dsci:
      managementState: Managed
      metrics:
        exporters:
          otlp/external:
            endpoint: https://metrics.example.com:4317
            tls:
              insecure: false
      traces:
        exporters:
          otlp/external:
            endpoint: https://traces.example.com:4317
```

Also install **CLO** from OperatorHub for log forwarding. Do **not** enable COO or Tempo.

You can omit built-in `traces.storage` when you use exporters only. Optionally add a temporary `debug` exporter during setup to confirm traffic in collector logs, then remove it for production.

#### Mode 4 — Custom examples

**Metrics only** — `values-mode4-metrics.yaml`:

```yaml
components:
  dashboard:
    dsc:
      managementState: Managed
services:
  monitoring:
    dependencies:
      clusterObservability: true
      opentelemetry: true
      tempo: false
    dsci:
      managementState: Managed
      metrics:
        storage:
          size: 10Gi
          retention: 30d
```

**Traces only** — `values-mode4-traces.yaml`:

```yaml
components:
  dashboard:
    dsc:
      managementState: Managed
services:
  monitoring:
    dependencies:
      clusterObservability: false
      opentelemetry: true
      tempo: true
    dsci:
      managementState: Managed
      traces:
        storage:
          backend: pv
          size: 5Gi
```

**Metrics plus remote write** — under `dsci.metrics`:

```yaml
exporters:
  prometheusremotewrite/external:
    endpoint: https://prometheus.example.com/api/v1/write
```

### Common verification commands

```bash
oc get csv -n redhat-ods-operator
oc get dsci default-dsci -o jsonpath='{.spec.monitoring.managementState}{"\n"}'
oc get pods -n redhat-ods-monitoring
oc get monitoring default-monitoring
```

---

## 3. Mode 1 — All built-in observability

### Prerequisites

- Cluster administrator access
- Helm install with `values-mode1-builtin.yaml` ([§2](#2-install-with-helm))
- From OperatorHub: **Red Hat OpenShift Logging** and **Loki Operator**
- COO, OpenTelemetry, and Tempo installed by the chart when monitoring dependencies are enabled

For CLO and Loki install details, see [Installing OpenShift Logging](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_logging/6.6/html/installing_logging/overview-of-openshift-logging-installation).

### Configuration

Equivalent `DSCInitialization` fragment:

```yaml
spec:
  monitoring:
    managementState: Managed
    namespace: redhat-ods-monitoring
    metrics:
      storage:
        size: 5Gi
        retention: 90d
    traces:
      sampleRatio: "0.1"
      storage:
        backend: pv
        size: 5Gi
        retention: 2160h
```

### Enabling built-in logs (Loki)

Metrics and traces are set from Helm / `DSCInitialization`. To enable log forwarding to Loki, configure the platform **Monitoring** custom resource and provide object storage.

1. Provide S3-compatible object storage and a bucket for Loki.
2. Create a secret in the monitoring namespace (`redhat-ods-monitoring`) with the keys required by Loki (for example `access_key_id`, `access_key_secret`, `bucketnames`, `endpoint`, `region`).
3. Configure logs on the Monitoring resource:

```yaml
spec:
  logs:
    storage:
      type: s3
      secretName: <your-s3-secret>
      credentialMode: static
      storageClassName: <storage-class>
```

4. Confirm `LokiStackAvailable` and `ClusterLogForwarderAvailable` are `True` on the Monitoring resource (`oc get monitoring default-monitoring -o yaml`).
5. Label the monitoring namespace for privileged Pod Security so OpenShift Logging collectors can use `hostPath` volumes:

```bash
oc label ns redhat-ods-monitoring \
  pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce=privileged \
  pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce-version=latest \
  pod-security.kubernetes.io/audit=privileged \
  pod-security.kubernetes.io/audit-version=latest \
  pod-security.kubernetes.io/warn=privileged \
  pod-security.kubernetes.io/warn-version=latest \
  security.openshift.io/scc.podSecurityLabelSync=false \
  --overwrite
```

### Verification

1. Confirm pods such as Prometheus, Alertmanager, OpenTelemetry Collector, Tempo, Perses, and Thanos Querier are Running in `redhat-ods-monitoring`.
2. Confirm the Monitoring resource is Ready: `oc get monitoring default-monitoring`.
3. In OpenShift AI, open **Observe & monitor → Dashboard** and confirm the **Cluster** and **Models** tabs load. Tabs may show “No data” until workloads produce metrics; that is different from a missing dashboard experience.
4. If you enabled logs, confirm LokiStack and ClusterLogForwarder conditions are available on the Monitoring resource.

---

## 4. Mode 2 — External observability only

### Prerequisites

- Helm install with `values-mode2-external.yaml` ([§2](#2-install-with-helm))
- **Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry** (via the chart)
- **Red Hat OpenShift Logging** from OperatorHub for log forwarding

Do not install COO, Tempo, or Loki for this mode. Logs use OpenShift Logging, not the OpenTelemetry Collector.

### Configuration

Forward metrics and traces with OpenTelemetry exporters (example):

```yaml
spec:
  monitoring:
    managementState: Managed
    namespace: redhat-ods-monitoring
    metrics:
      exporters:
        otlp/external:
          endpoint: https://metrics.example.com:4317
          tls:
            insecure: false
    traces:
      exporters:
        otlp/external:
          endpoint: https://traces.example.com:4317
```

Configure OpenShift Logging to forward cluster logs to your external logging system. OpenShift AI does not create a ClusterLogForwarder for this mode from the exporters-only monitoring configuration.

### Verification

1. Confirm OpenTelemetry Collector pods are Running in `redhat-ods-monitoring`.
2. Confirm there is no built-in MonitoringStack, Tempo, or Perses stack for platform storage/dashboards.
3. In OpenShift AI, confirm **Observe & monitor** is not available (no built-in observability dashboards).
4. Confirm metrics and traces reach your external backend (or use a temporary `debug` exporter and inspect collector logs during setup).

---

## 5. Mode 3 — No observability

### Prerequisites

None for observability operators. Use `values-mode3-none.yaml` ([§2](#2-install-with-helm)).

### Configuration

```yaml
spec:
  monitoring:
    managementState: Removed
```

### Trade-offs

OpenShift AI does not deploy platform metrics, traces, or observability dashboards. Individual components may still expose their own metrics. To enable observability later, switch to Mode 1 or Mode 4.

### Verification

1. Confirm `spec.monitoring.managementState` is `Removed` on `default-dsci`.
2. Confirm monitoring operands are not running in `redhat-ods-monitoring`.
3. In OpenShift AI, confirm **Observe & monitor** is not in the navigation. The OpenShift AI application can remain available when the dashboard component is Managed.

---

## 6. Mode 4 — Custom

Use the Mode 4 values examples in [§2](#2-install-with-helm).

### Capability matrix

| Capability | Built-in option | Required operators |
|------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Metrics** | MonitoringStack and OpenTelemetry Collector | COO, OpenTelemetry |
| **Tracing** | Tempo and OpenTelemetry Collector | OpenTelemetry, Tempo |
| **Logs** | Loki-based forwarding | CLO, Loki |
| **Dashboards** | Perses dashboards in OpenShift AI | COO (with metrics) |

### Examples

**Metrics with remote write:**

```yaml
spec:
  monitoring:
    managementState: Managed
    metrics:
      storage:
        size: 10Gi
        retention: 30d
      exporters:
        prometheusremotewrite/external:
          endpoint: https://prometheus.example.com/api/v1/write
```

**Traces only (persistent volume):**

```yaml
spec:
  monitoring:
    managementState: Managed
    traces:
      storage:
        backend: pv
        size: 5Gi
```

### Verification

**Metrics only**

1. Confirm MonitoringStack / Prometheus pods are Running and Tempo is not deployed.
2. In OpenShift AI, open **Observe & monitor → Dashboard** and confirm Cluster / Models tabs are available.

**Traces only**

1. Confirm Tempo and the OpenTelemetry Collector are Running and MonitoringStack is not deployed.
2. Perses may still be present for Tempo-related views. **Observe & monitor** can remain visible; Cluster and Models panels that require Prometheus show datasource errors until metrics are enabled. Enable metrics (or use Mode 1) if you need those dashboards.

---

## 7. Operator reference

| Operator | Package (OperatorHub) | Typical namespace | Helm chart value |
|----------|----------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Cluster Observability Operator | `cluster-observability-operator` | `openshift-cluster-observability-operator` | `services.monitoring.dependencies.clusterObservability` |
| Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry | `opentelemetry-product` | `openshift-opentelemetry-operator` | `services.monitoring.dependencies.opentelemetry` |
| Tempo Operator | `tempo-product` | `openshift-tempo-operator` | `services.monitoring.dependencies.tempo` |
| Loki Operator | `loki-operator` | `openshift-operators-redhat` | OperatorHub |
| Red Hat OpenShift Logging | `cluster-logging` | `openshift-logging` | OperatorHub (not in chart) |

Example subscription for COO (adapt channel for your OpenShift version; use the same pattern for OpenTelemetry and Tempo when installing from OperatorHub):

```yaml
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: cluster-observability-operator
  namespace: openshift-cluster-observability-operator
spec:
  channel: stable
  name: cluster-observability-operator
  source: redhat-operators
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
  installPlanApproval: Automatic
```

Dashboards use Perses custom resources managed through COO. There is no separate Perses Operator prerequisite.

---

## 8. Release notes — Observability dashboards general availability

In Red Hat OpenShift AI **3.6**, observability dashboards that were Technology Preview in earlier releases are **generally available**. Documentation also describes four observability deployment modes and Helm-based configuration.

| Dashboard | Access |
|-----------|--------|
| Cluster | Cluster administrators |
| Models | All users (project-scoped) |
| Usage | Model-as-a-Service usage metrics |
| LLM Traffic | llm-d |
| LLM Performance | llm-d |
| LLM Utilization | llm-d |

**What's new**

- Observability dashboards generally available
- Four deployment modes with operator prerequisites
- Per-mode Helm values (`services.monitoring`) and verification guidance
- Built-in log forwarding to Loki via the Monitoring resource (object storage and OpenShift Logging required)
